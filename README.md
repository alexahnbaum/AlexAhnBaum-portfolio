# AlexAhnBaum-Portfolio

## My personal portfolio

A portfolio that explains who I am, contains links to my live projects, and includes contact information.   

As a student in the UC Berkeley Extension Coding Full Stack Boot Camp, we were tasked with creating a first iteration of our portfolio.  Because this was our first iteration, we needed to include basic HTML and CSS to give our portfolio structure and design respectively.  We were tasked with including content in both coding languages that we have been taught and exposed to in the first two weeks of our coding boot camp.  Being this is my first attempt at making my portfolio, I plan to iterate on this project in the near future.

### MOTIVATION ###

My motivation for creating my personal portfolio was to create a place where potential hiring managers can see a sample of my projects and read up on who I am.  The portfolio needed to provide information, links, and contact information.  It needed to be presented in a succinct manner that includes having the following content: 

 - my name
 - a recent photo
 - sections to my page
 - links to applications included in a "projects" section
 - contact information
 - responsive arrangement to be viewed from multiple view-ports

### WHAT ARE THE PROBLEMS IDENTIFIED? ###

The two problems I faced when creating my personal portfolio involved using the CSS Flexbox layout model and CSS Media Queries to view the page from multiple view-ports correctly.    

- Flexbox: Initially, I had challenges understanding the Flexbox model.  It was also challenging for me to understand the properties needed to write in CSS classes, as well as what would be affected on my webpage when I wrote properties into specific classes.  An example of this is I had challenges understanding whether or not to write properties of the Flexbox model in the parent, grandparent, and child classes.

- Media Queries: Using media queries at the bottom of the CSS page was challenging for me because I had difficulty understanding whether to use min-width vs. max-width.  I also had challenges understanding what properties to include for each class I wanted to effect at different view-port widths.  For example, because I am still learning the many CSS properties, it took a lot of trial and error to see what worked with shrinking the images in my projects section.  This leads me to my next challenge, that of using the correct percentages to shrink the images of my projects section to the correct ratio at each viewport change.  This also took a lot of trial and error for me to find what worked.

### WHAT ARE THE SOLUTIONS? ###

My solutions came about through mainly trial and error.  I also had support from the teacher's assistant (TA) in the boot camp class I am enrolled in.  The TA gave me advice on both the Flexbox model and using Media Queries.  I also used resources available to me through the boot camp I am enrolled in, such as reviewing recorded class videos in which Flexbox and Media Queries were covered, and websites provided to us as students that gave us practice/drills on these topics.

- Solutions to using the Flexbox model: After using resources available to me, in particular the practice/drill website [flexbox froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/), I understood visually how a container can take on "flex" properties, and how to change such properties in the CSS code.  What took me longer to understand were what properties to use and where to use them (ie. child, parent, grandparent, etc. classes).  My solution to this only came about through much trial and error.  

- Solutions to Media Queries: I used similar resources mentioned above that were available to me to help with my understanding of using Media Queries to contain CSS properties that changed in multiple view-ports.  In particular, I used the boot camp classroom repository from GitLab to review past student activities on Media Queries.  Upon viewing these, and with much trial and error, I was able to use Media Queries to change properties when viewing my webpage from different view-ports.

### WHAT WAS LEARNED? ###

I've learned that my abilities to implement knowledge learned in the boot camp is a slow process.  I know I will become more efficient over time, but because I am completely new to the development landscape, I know that I have to take things slow.  Upon reflection of what I learned in this process, I would argue the greatest thing learned during the time creating my personal portfolio involves my executive functioning skills in front end HTML and CSS tasks.  Of course my knowledge of specific items, such as the Flexbox model layout, did grow.  However, I would argue the growth in my executive functioning skills with relation to front end development was more profound.  Some executive functioning skills I gained include using resources available to me in an efficient way, collaborating with those available to me (my TA), and a better overall understanding of basic HTML and CSS structure.

### CREDITS ###

During the course of making this first iteration of my personal portfolio, I worked with my boot camp TA, Nicholas Gambino.  Mr. Gambino met with me in an office hour session to give me advice on using the Flexbox layout and Media Queries in my CSS code.  

I reviewed old classroom recordings from my boot camp.

I used the following practice/drill website:
